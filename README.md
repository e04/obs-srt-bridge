# obs-srt-bridge

A bridge that allows OBS Studio to display live **SRT** (Secure Reliable Transport) connection statistics and automatically switch scenes based on connection health.  
The project consists of a tiny Go server that embeds a React single-page application which is loaded in OBS as a _Browser Source_.

## Related Tools

This tool is designed to work together with the following tools. Please check them out as well:

- **[srt-live-reporter](https://github.com/e04/srt-live-reporter)** - A proxy that provides SRT statistics via WebSocket
- **[go-srtla](https://github.com/e04/go-srtla)** - A cross-platform SRTLA receiver

## Features

- **Live SRT Statistics Display**: Real-time monitoring of SRT connection quality and statistics
- **Multiple Display Types**: Choose between simple text display, graph visualization, or no display
- **Automatic Scene Switching**: Automatically switches OBS scenes based on connection health
  - Switches to the "online" scene when SRT connection is stable and healthy
  - Switches to the "offline" scene when connection is lost or experiencing issues
  - Configurable scene names via URL parameters

## Run

```bash
$ ./obs-srt-bridge -port 9999
Browser Source URL: http://localhost:9999/app
```

Leave the process running while OBS is open.

### Command-line flags

| Flag    | Default | Description                                   |
| ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-port` | `9999`  | HTTP port that serves the browser source HTML |

## Adding the Browser Source to OBS

1. In OBS Studio choose **+ â†’ Browser Source**.
2. Enter the URL shown when you started the program, for example:
   - `http://localhost:9999/app?type=simple&wsport=8888&onlineSceneName=ONLINE&offlineSceneName=OFFLINE`
3. **For automatic scene switching**: If you are using the `onlineSceneName` and `offlineSceneName` parameters, you must set the **Page permission** to **Advanced access** in the Browser Source properties. This allows the application to control OBS scene switching.

> **Note**: The `onlineSceneName` and `offlineSceneName` parameters enable automatic scene switching based on connection status. When the SRT connection is healthy, OBS will automatically switch to the specified online scene. When the connection is lost or experiencing quality issues, it will switch to the offline scene.

All query parameters are optional:

| Parameter          | Default   | Meaning                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`             | `simple`  | `simple`, `graph` or `none`                                                                                                |
| `wsport`           | `8888`    | Port where your SRT statistics WebSocket is listening (use [srt-live-reporter](https://github.com/e04/srt-live-reporter) ) |
| `onlineSceneName`  | `ONLINE`  | Scene name to switch to when the connection is healthy                                                                     |
| `offlineSceneName` | `OFFLINE` | Scene name to switch to when the connection is lost or poor                                                                |

## Build

```bash
# Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/e04/obs-srt-bridge.git
$ cd obs-srt-bridge

# 1. Build the Browser Source bundle
$ cd frontend
$ npm ci           # installs dependencies
$ npm run build    # outputs to frontend/dist
$ cd ..

# 2. Build the Go binary (this embeds the bundle produced above)
$ go build -o obs-srt-bridge
```

On **macOS** and **Linux** this will create an executable named `obs-srt-bridge`  
On **Windows** the resulting file is `obs-srt-bridge.exe`.
